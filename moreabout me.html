        Being introvert I spend most of my time watching k-drama and c-drama. I also have interest in writing  you can check it in the writing.
         Living in this fast pace world we have to catch up with so many things. Thoughts about different things varies with different people and the emvironment they are living in. 
        All of us have different thinking and prespective about things but by organizing these diverse ideas we can create something new and beautiful. I believe that everyone of us is 
    unique and has different things that we exel in and if we improve those thing then we can make the better place to live.

    I have read and heard about many great personalities who have made changes in the society. In different field there are different personalities who have leave some marks in that field and 
    system. I belive that we should be respected regardless of our gender, family, ethincity and other things. Many people say that they want to make change in the society and world but very less people 
    work towards it.
