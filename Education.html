        <p> I am currently styding in <a href ="https://bnks.edu.np/#/">Budhanilkantha School.</a> My former 
            school was Saint Joshep Secondary School. Budhanilkantha School is a residental school. It is
            compulsary for everyone to stay in the school. Living in the hostel far away from your parent's is hard.
            We have to manage all the things by our self. Living in  Budhanilkantha School for almost 5 years, I 
            learned time management.

          I am a very active learner. I am always curious about new things. My major interest lies in the cardiology.
          Before learning the difference between <b>Hope</b> and <b>Wish</b> I used to say "I wish to be a heart surgeon."
          After learning the difference between them, I say "I hope to become a heart surgeon oneday." Well it means I 
          already 50-50 chance of becoming one. So, those who all want to become something it's better to hope then wish because if we hope we already completed
          50% of our journey towards becoming one.
