            <h4> ‘The Ant and the Grasshopper’.</h4> <br>
            The elder brother was hardworking like ant from the “Ant and Grasshopper”. Ant used to work day and night and save the food and 
            grains for the future. Likewise, ant George was also hardworking and responsible person who cared about his family reputation
             and future of all the members of his family. But to his contrast was Tom. Tom was very irresponsible person he didn’t care for 
             his family reputation. Tom would spend his money endlessly and had no job. Tom used to believe that “the money you spent on the 
             necessities was boring; the money that was amusing to spend was the money you spend on luxuries.” On the other hand, George was serious and respectable person. George would 
             spend his money on the necessities then luxury.

                  George was a respectable man didn’t know any tricks and was always focused on his work 
                  and insensible to any kind of enticements. While tom was charming and unscrupulous person. Tom even burrowed money from his friends that he made 
                   on his journey and cheated and blackmailed his own brother. Tom was not family-oriented person unlike his brother. Tom was selfish and liked
                   to enjoy his life without working like grasshopper in the “Ant and Grasshopper”. Tom was always the trouble the trouble maker whereas George was
                   the person who used to solve all the problems caused by Tom.

            <h4>Sports losing its popularity in youngs....</h4><br>
            By – 5016 Sadikshya<br>
            Budhanilkantha School – 2nd July<br>
            <p>
                Students of the one of the most prestigious school has been losing interest in sports activities. Being of the students 
                there I took a little survey with the students and guardians about the reason behind it. It is the phase when students should
                 show more interest in sports activities but it seems they are losing it instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                School focus more on study then on the sports. Having the top students of the country competition between the students
                 for academics is also high. Many students here said that “I don’t have time to participate in any sports activities as 
                 those activities doesn’t help them in increasing their grades at all.” Parents also want their children to excel in academics.
                  Parents sees their children academics performance and tell them to focus on their study then on sports activities.
            </p>

                Following all of these, the facilities that school provides to its students are also not best. There are large number of
                 students in the class but equipment is insufficient for all the students. The condition of the fields and courts are also
                  in poor condition. “The fields have puddle in them if we go and play then our shoes will get damaged or we will get hurt.” 
                  Due to insufficient sports equipment and poor condition of fields and courts those who are interested also doesn’t play or get to play.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sports helps to make us fit and healthy physically and mentally so school should focus on sporting activities as it does to academic activities.
                Mr. Sharma said “Due to high academics pressure my child is not in good mental health. School should conduct some program for them and give them less
                 pressure.” School should also improve their facilities and should attract students to sporting activities. Enough equipment should be provided to all
                  the students. They should be allowed to participate in the sports they like instead of forcing then. The qualified and trained coaches should be employed
                   and students should be given a proper education about sports rather than random knowledge. More competition between the houses and individuals should be 
                   organize with more attractive prizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students the days are attractive to digital games. But budhanilkantha being the residentials school have high advantage in making its students
                 focus more on physical games. It should organize more games and give training to its students with qualified trainer with good facilities, then students
                 will surely regain their interest in sporting activities. If the students are encouraged at their young age then later they may serve their country as it’s player.
